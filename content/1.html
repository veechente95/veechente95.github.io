<h1> Easy healthy meal prep ideas </h1><br />
    Are you looking for some quick and easy meal prep ideas? Eating healthy doesn't have to be hard or take a lot of time - and meal prepping is a great way to make sure you have a healthy meal ready when you need it! <br />
    Here are some of my favorite healthy meal prep ideas:<br />
    1. Overnight oats: Just mix up rolled oats, your favorite yogurt, some fresh or frozen fruit, and a sweetener such as honey or maple syrup the night before. In the morning, you'll have a delicious, healthy breakfast ready to go!<br />
    2. Mason jar salads: Layer salad ingredients such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, and your favorite protein source in a mason jar. When you're ready to eat, just shake it up and enjoy!<br />
    3. Roasted veggies: Preheat the oven to 400Â°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Chop up your favorite vegetables (such as sweet potatoes, broccoli, or cauliflower) and drizzle with a bit of olive oil and your favorite seasonings. Roast for about 20 minutes, and you'll have some delicious roasted veggies ready to go!<br />
    4. Meal-sized portions of quinoa: Cook quinoa according to the instructions on the package, and portion it out into individual containers. You can add some cooked protein such as chicken or beans, and top with your favorite sauce or dressing.<br />
    5. Smoothie bags: Put all the ingredients for your favorite smoothie in a zipper-lock bag and freeze. When you're ready to make your smoothie, just add your favorite liquid (such as milk or juice) and blend!<br />
    With these easy meal prep ideas, you can make sure you always have a delicious and healthy meal ready to go!</body>
